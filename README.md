This is a simple Pokedex app for people to look up statistics and

## Introduction
The Pokémon franchise started off in its first generation with its initial release of Pocket Monsters Aka and Midori ("Red" and "Green", respectively) for the Game Boy in Japan on February 27, 1996. When these games proved extremely popular, an enhanced Pokemon Ao ("Blue") version was released sometime after, and the Ao version was reprogrammed as Pokémon Red and Blue for international release. The games launched in the United States on September 30, 1998 and have been an international smash-hit ever since.

The number of Pokemon has grown dramatically, and it can be hard to keep track of all of them.
